<p> For our css design, we chose to implement a "digital" theme. We wanted the overall theme to be representative of computer science. 
We used a color scheme of green, light blue, dark blue, and black. We thought green was reminiscent of the Matrix movies and old-school 
computer text, and we thought blue went well with green. Our background image further reinforces the Matrix-like aesthetic, with vertically 
arranged characters similar to the falling green characters from the movies. </p>
<p> We also chose a couple fonts with a digital feel to them, one pixelated font for the headers and nav bar, and a more readable font for
the rest of the text. The background image of the audio divs was also set to headphones, which are of course frequently used with computers.
</p>
<p> Furthermore, we added a few features to make the website more usable and give it a slicker feel. The header div was fixed to the top of
the window, so that users can easily mouse over to click on a link to another part of the site without having to scroll all the way up. We
also gave the table under the classmates section a more horizontal layout, so users don't have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the
page to find a particular person. Each entry in the table is marked off as a box with a green background color consistant with the color
scheme. Lastly, the links in the website header were set to light up when users hover over them. This small interactive aspect makes the 
site feel much smoother.</p>
