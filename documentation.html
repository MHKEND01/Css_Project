<p> For our css design, we chose to implement a "digital" theme. We wanted the overall theme to be representative of computer science. 
We used a color scheme of green, light blue, and black. We thought green was reminiscent of the Matrix movies and old-school 
computer text, and we thought blue went well with green. Our background image further reinforces the Matrix-like aesthetic, with vertically 
arranged characters similar to the falling green characters from the movies. </p>
<p> We also chose a couple fonts with a digital feel to them, one pixelated font for the headers, and a more readable font for
the rest of the text. The background image of the audio divs was also set to an image of a digitally-rendered soundwave. The dimensions of 
the audio div were made small enough to not cover the profile image, while being made large enough to
be easily clicked. Our specifications for the audio div are consistant with the theme and allows for easy user interactivity.
</p>
<p> Furthermore, we added a few features to make the website more usable and give it a slicker feel. The header div was fixed to the top of
the window, so that users can easily mouse over to click links without having to scroll all the way up. We
also gave the table under the classmates section a horizontal layout, so users don't have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the
page to find a particular person. Each entry in the table is marked off as a box with a background image consistant with the theme. 
Lastly, we should note that when users access the home page, classmates page, or peer grading pages, the header has a short animation. The 
 header appears to be typed in, with a flashing input cursor appearing next to the text. This response to users loading the page provides
a small interactive touch which acts as an additional reminder of the theme.</p>
